# Duck Hunt #  

## This is a much more simple version of the classic game Duck Hunt I made for class. Below are all the rules you need to know. ##  

+ A duck will fly across the screen at a random point.  
+ You need to shoot down as many ducks as you can via clicking on them in a 10 second time frame.  
+ After 10 seconds the game ends. At this point you will see your final score with an accuracy bonus.  

## (WARNING!!!!!!) PLEASE PLAY THIS USING A CODEHS SANDBOX, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK: ##
